Deployment Link: [TransitFlow Vercel Link](https://nupat-internship-test-6g2i.vercel.app/)

Tools used
1. React
2. TypeScript
3. Tailwind CSS

DISCLAIMER: This app was built to suit perfectly only one screen-width (1920px) as the only available design was for desktop screens (1920px X 1080px) and also the
the responsiveness of the app was not required to complete this task

Challenges
1. Screen responsiveness
2. Slow loading of app initially due to large file sizes  of images from the figma file

Gains
1. Practical use of resusable components.
2. Utilization of dummy data and resusable components greately reduced code repetition.
2. Using typed definitions with TypeScript reduced development bugs.
3. User-friendly Tailwind CSS utility classes.
